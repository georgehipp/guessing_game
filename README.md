Learning rust with a Guessing Game

Started Here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html

Additional:
* Unit Test: src/main.rs
  * secret_number_is_btw_0_100
* Integration Test: tests/integration.rs
  * launching_game_exit
  * launching_game_exit_two
* Additional Ordering Examples
* Additional Function Examples

Commands:
* cargo test - Run All Tests
* cargo run - Run binary from target/debug
* cargo build --bins - Build binary

Used this as a entry point to learn some rust, worked out well! Figured out some testing, loops, cargo, etc.
